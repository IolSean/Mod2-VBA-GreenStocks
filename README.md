This is for you Steve.
# Modules 1-4
These comprise the exercises and correspond to the same sheets in the workbook
# Challenge
This is module 5 in the code editor. It is similar to the exercise in its formatting, input request, rowcount, and ticker index.
The following things should be noted for the refactor,
  -Nested loops were used to populate the requested column data as it is sequentially iterated through once (rather than for each ticker)
  -This works for as long as the data sheets (named for their year) are organized alphabetically by ticker index and chronologically
  -This could also be broken if new ticker indexes were added
